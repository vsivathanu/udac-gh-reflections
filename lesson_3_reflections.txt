When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For collaborations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Gives us more choice to specify exactly what changes we want on the local computer. Useful when there are many contributers to a project working on things not all of which we're interested in.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork: copy another person's repository to work independently on it
clone: copying from remote to local, or from local to local
branch: make changes to existing branch, without affecting the main branch. Can be useful if we want to merge later (like for a separate feature)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
it is useful when merging the local copy with the remote copy because the remote copy needs to know the common ancestor. (however, if the commit history is there, won't we automatically know the common ancestor?)

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Github
harder: merging, keeping track(commits)
easier: coding would be faster (less steps, no commits)
