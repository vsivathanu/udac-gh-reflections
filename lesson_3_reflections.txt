When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For collaborations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Gives us more choice to specify exactly what changes we want on the local computer. Useful when there are many contributers to a project working on things not all of which we're interested in.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork: copy another person's repository to work independently on it
clone: copying from remote to local, or from local to local
branch: make changes to existing branch, without affecting the main branch. Can be useful if we want to merge later (like for a separate feature)
